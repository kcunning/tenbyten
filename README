Description:
	Command-line based python game, text adventure style.

Features:

0.1:
	Create rooms linked to each other
	Rooms will have ordinal orientation to each other
	Rooms will save to a text file for now, as I am on a train and have had a brain fart about how to write SQL commands. Thank you, Django!
